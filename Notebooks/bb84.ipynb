    "\n",
    "### First, private key cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you've written a secret note that you only want your best friend to read. To keep it secret, you decide to scramble the letters in a specific way, a way that only you and your friend understand. This method of scrambling is your _key_. Now, even if someone else gets the note, they won't understand what it says because it's all scrambled up. Your friend, who knows the key, can unscramble the note to read the original message. This is the basic idea behind the private key, or symmetric, cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private key cryptography is a type of encryption where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the message. You use the key (a specific set of instructions) to convert your message into a secret code, and the same key is used to convert the secret code back into the original message. Because the same key is used for both processes, it's really important to keep the key secret. If someone else gets the key, they can decode all of your messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge in private key cryptography is securely sharing the key with the person you want to communicate with. If you're not careful, someone else might intercept the key and decode your messages. This is known as the _key distribution problem_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Key Distribution to the rescue!\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers a solution to this problem using the principles of quantum mechanics. In the quantum world, measuring a system can change its state. This is called the _observer effect._ If someone tries to intercept the key and measure these qubits, they will inevitably change their states. Your best friend will notice these changes when he receives the qubits, so they will know there was an eavesdropper. QKD solves the key distribution problem by enabling you and your friend to detect eavesdropping. If there's no eavesdropping, you can use the sequence of qubits that you've sent and your friend received to create a secret key. If there is eavesdropping, you discard the key and try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "BB84 is one of the protocols realizing the idea of QKD.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our battle plan and idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will not dive deep into the mathematics (physics) behind every aspect of the protocol. I will provide you with references if you want to dive deeper. **Within the scope of this notebook we are focused on building the BB84 protocol using cirq while allowing our solution not to be perfect because we are learning.**"

    "## Part 1: Noise-free BB84\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of the document, the sender will be called Alice and the receiver will be called Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement noise-free BB84 we will follow these steps:\n",
    " 1. Alice will generate two random binary (consisting only of `0`s and `1`s) strings - `alice_a`, and `alice_b` - of the same length.\n",
    " 2. Alice will use her strings to prepare a quantum state (sequence of qubits) that she will send to Bob.\n",
    " 3. Bob will generate a random binary string `bob_b` that he will use to try to _guess_ and decode Alice's message. Then Bob tells Alice that he received and measured the state he received.\n",
    " 4. Alice and Bob exchange their `_b` strings. They discard all bits that do not match (from Alice's original message and Bob's guess-decoded message). They are left with `alice_kept_a` and `bob_kept_a` strings, respectively.\n",
    " 5. Alice picks a random set of indices of `alice_kept_a` - `test_indices` and sends them to Bob. Alice and Bob use `test_indices` to create binary strings `alice_test_a` and `bob_test_a`. **If any of the bits miss-match they restart the procedure**\n",
    " 6. They now use remaining indices (without `test_indices`) - `final_indices` - and treat is as a seed for key creation via the process of privacy amplification (we will discuss it later, do not worry!)\n",

In the case of the BB84 protocol, we assume that Eve _cannot_ impersonate either Alice or Bob when they are communicating over a classical channel - when they are sending classical bits (as opposed to sending qubits). But what Eve can _try to do_ is to eavesdrop. But as opposed to the classical scenario **copying arbitrary qubits without introducing noise** is impossible. This is called the [no-cloning theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem). Basically, the very laws of nature make it impossible to copy the state of the qubit _without_ measuring it. But, if you recall - when we apply `H`-gate we have a 50-50 chance of observing either `1` or `0`. So thinking like a bad actor we come up with the following strategy:\n",
    " 1. We will intercept a quantum message that goes from Alice to Bob.\n",

    "### Step 6 (Updated)\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, we were meant to perform privacy amplification. But due to Eve's interference Alice and Bob cannot be sure that even the remaining qubits measurements are the same. To fix the potential errors we will use a process aptly named **Error correction**. That topic is _big_, _deep_ and _important_ in quantum computing, Here we will only provide a high-level overview and leverage relatively simple techniques. You can read about that in the [TU Delft's lecture notes](https://ocw.tudelft.nl/wp-content/uploads/LN_Week5.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Error correction, when performed over authenticated (that is - you are _sure_ who is a sender and a receiver) classical channel is called **Information reconciliation**. We will explore one technique to do that called **Syndrome coding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So what is information reconciliation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Information reconciliation ensures the sender and the receiver, Alice and Bob, hold the same string of information. This is necessary because as we saw we are dealing with noise during the communication. The process (on a high level) works like this: Alice and Bob's exchange error-correcting information to correct any discrepancies in their strings. The goal is to make sure that after reconciliation, the strings held by Alice and Bob are mostly-correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that all classical communication between Alice and Bob is public, which means an eavesdropper (Eve) can also gain information from the error correction information they send across. Therefore, the process must be designed to minimize the information leakage to Eve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fun, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syndrome coding using linear codes\n",
    "\n",
    "In syndrome coding, the idea is to add extra bits to the original data being transmitted. These extra bits do not carry additional information per se, but they are there to help detect and correct errors that may occur during data transmission. Linear codes are one of the concrete implementations of syndrome coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's keep in mind what we are trying to do - **We want to detect and correct errors that might occur when information is transmitted across a noisy channel**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what makes code linear? Let's say you have a list of binary strings that you want to use as code. They will be called linear if when you take any two codes and add them together (modulo 2 or XOR) resulting code will also be in the original list. For math-savvy folks - the codes need to form a linear space. This property will be leveraged in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular linear codes is called [Hamming(7, 4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming(7,4)). We will use it as an example but note that Alice could use _any linear code_ (which can be represented as a pair of matrices, but we will not deal with it right now). She could different linear codes every time!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will describe the procedure on a high level, then we will actually fill in the missing details.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We used `test_indices` to obtain test strings. We will use the remaining indices for further processing. The strings obtained from using those indices will be called `alice_final_a`, `bob_final_a`.\n",
    "2. Alice will encode the message to obtain `encoded_final_a`. Alice will then send this message to Bob.\n",
    "3. We know that `bob_final_a` is basically a sum of `alice_final_a` and some noise - which could be represented as a binary vector of the same length and `alice_final_a`. Because we are using linear codes the following property holds `encode(a + b) == encode(a) + encode(b)` (I told you that this is important property!). So Bob has the message `bob_final_a == alice_final_a + noise`, using the linear property of linear code we have `encode(bob_final_a) == encode(alice_final_a + noise) == encode(alice_final_a) + encode(noise)`. If Alice now will send him `encoded_final_a == encode(alice_final_a)`, then Bob can subtract it from his encoded string to obtain encoded noise. Then he can `decode` his noise and subtract his `decoded_noise` from `bob_final_a` to obtain `alice_final_a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that is a lot! So let's go step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 6.1\n",
    "That part is relatively simple - we will leverage the `test_indices_source` defined before to create `final` strings."

    "And it's time for Privacy Amplification. In our case, it's a very fancy name for hashing with guarantees. A quick reminder of what hashing is. It is a process that converts input data of any size into a fixed-size output. This output is known as the hash value, or simply hash. The main objective of a hash function is to ensure that even a small change in the input will produce a significant change in the output, thus creating a unique hash for unique input. Of course, the world is not perfect, so collisions can happen. A collision is when two different inputs generate the same hash output. Good hash functions are designed to minimize the probability of collisions, but it's practically impossible to eliminate them completely due to the fixed size of the hash output.\n",

    "We will construct a very simplified 2-parameter hash function. The first parameter will be the shared binary array (`alice_final_a` and `bob_clean_a`), the second parameter will be a `seed` value provided by Alice and shared with Bob. The"
